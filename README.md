## Introduction

This repository contains the project files for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course on Coursera. The goal of the project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset.

## Data Source

The data used for this project is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, which can be found at:

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Dependencies

List of any dependencies or packages required to run the script.
- dplyr
- tidyr

## Script: run_analysis.R

The `run_analysis.R` script performs the following steps:

see `CodeaBook.md` part of Transformations

## How to use the script

1. Download and unzip the dataset.
2. Set the working directory to the folder containing the dataset.
3. Ensure the `dplyr` package is installed in R or RStudio.
4. Run the `run_analysis.R` script.

## Output

The script outputs a tidy dataset (indepenant), which can be used for further analysis.

## Additional Files
